# Cybersecurity Roadmap

### As put forth by UnixGuy @ https://www.youtube.com/@UnixGuy

## Step 1

**Google certificate**. Once you‚Äôre done with this, you can do CompTIA Security+ (you get 30% off once done with the Google course) or ISC^2. However, UG recommends you do neither. Instead, go to Step 2.

> **Note:** Many people intend on doing CompTIA Security+ anyway due to HR filters and because, apparently, HR departments specifically look for it, so‚Ä¶ judgment call? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Step 2

Blue Team Level 1.

## Step 3

Do the projects in the ‚Äúprojects you NEED to get hired‚Äù video.

As you go through Blue Team and as you do the projects, you‚Äôre adding these to your CV, both as projects and skills.

By this point, you should start applying to any and all cybersecurity positions, even if you only meet 10% of requirements. Do not just go for your specialization.

## Step 4. Choose Specialization

**Forensics:**

- **Option 1**. Computer Forensics Specialization by INFOSEC, comprising 3 courses. Note: Windows specific.
- **Option 2**. Practical Windows Forensics by TCM security.
- **Forensics certifications**: GCFE and GCFA. Will open doors. Prohibitive cost. ‚ÄúCheap certs‚Äù video gives tips on how to get them cheaper.

**Threat management:**

- Become a Splunk expert. All training free on their website.

**Threat intelligence:**

- Not many acceptable certs. Use MISP‚Äôs platform and read through their documentation, get practice. There‚Äôs also SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence Institute but cost prohibitive.
- TCM has two Python courses. Cheap and excellent for building practical skills.

**Undecided?**

- Then do Blue Team level 2.
